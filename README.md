# MusicSearch
The goal of this project is to develop a MusicSearch engine that will find songs inside a database by using keywords that are set by the type of music a person searches.

# Simplicity and Security
This a must as the music will more than likey not be licensed to be downloaded legally so this is why the files of the database must be added and managed by you i will never list a public database of the files.

This being said the simple theme will use what i am very good with that being bootstrap using only a locally hosted file to prevent Content Deliverly Network issues.

As well as not adding the following things to add privacy issues listed below:

1. No Javascript of any kind to use anything at all. I choose to not track users at all nor open issues to people looking the site up using tor, NoScript, Etc..

2. No Extra modifcations that are purely for the sake of novelty and apparence

3. No direct linking will be allowed as many hosts are very grumpy about it even ones ignoring dcma as hosting it on the same server as the website causes issues. I know this is an odd one but personal experience is why i chose this so all files in the database will be hosted else where even when searched.

# Inital Development

I will be using the following to test and use in production as i have the most experience with these.

1. Html5, Bootstrap
2. PHP7.x Compatiable
3. LAMP Stack on a linux server ( i see no point in using anything windows based for a project like this let alone hosting it on windows on a productions server )

# Production Value
I am developing this for a client of mine that wanted a open and transparent music search engine that suited their needs that followed the above guidelines and i found a very special place in my heart for this project so i am doing it on my github.

There are quite a few private peer-to-peer search engines among other heavily outdated php meta based ones on the internet and as a result all of them both public and private sources would require a vast amount of work to be used so we decided on creating it ourselves.

The end goal is to be able to search the database of private music then allowing the end user to download the songs they look up using keywords just as any other meta search engine would but much more simple and secure. 

Thanks, Isrnameo
